## Classification of Malaria cell images

### Methods

* Data reading and format transforming is implemented in Cell_image class.
* Image features extracted by SURF is used as X for training instead of the original images.
* The feature selection is based on the sum of the Harr wavelet response.
* Four classification methods are used: KNN, Random Forest, SVC, DNN.

### Dataset

* The dataset is omitted. It can be downloaded from [kaggle datasets--cell images for detecting malaria](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria) and put it in project dictory.
